# Decisions

- **Phaser 3.90.0, not 4.x:** the plan specifies Phaser 3; npm `latest` is now 4, so 3 is pinned explicitly.
- **TypeScript 6.0.3, not 7:** typescript-eslint 8.71 supports TS `<6.1` only.
- **Folder `farm-game/` inside the `claudeing` repo:** the repo already holds an unrelated app at its root, so the game is isolated in a subfolder.
- **Tileset generated at runtime, no PNG yet:** a canvas texture is built in `PreloadScene`; `farm.tmj` references `placeholder.png` only as a Tiled-editor hint and Phaser ignores it. No 1px extrusion until real art in M7.
- **Farm map built by `scripts/generate-farm-map.mjs`:** produces valid `.tmj` that stays editable in Tiled afterward; `collision` layer is hidden and unused until M1.
- **M0 camera is static, zoomed to fit the 40x30 map:** movement and follow camera belong to M1.
- **`GameState` stub added in M0:** keeps state serializable from the start, as the plan requires.

## M1

- **Player position = feet-center in map px; hitbox is 10x6 at the feet:** keeps the sprite's head free to overlap walls (top-down depth) while collision stays tile-friendly.
- **Axis-separated collision with snap-to-edge, plus a 4px corner assist:** gives flush stops and lets a 10px hitbox slide into a 16px doorway without pixel-perfect alignment.
- **Doors trigger on walking onto the door tile; Interact is for objects (bed, bin):** matches the genre; a door tile is walkable, interactables are solid so the player stands beside them.
- **Input is locked after a door until the held direction is released once:** otherwise holding "up" through a door bounces the player straight back out.
- **Door spawn tiles must be walkable and must not be door tiles:** enforced by `tests/maps.test.ts` so map edits can't create loops.
- **Joystick direction uses axis hysteresis (1.25x):** prevents flicker when the thumb sits near a diagonal. Dragging past the rim drags the stick along.
- **Joystick appears only once the thumb passes the deadzone:** short taps (tap-to-use-tool) stay visually clean.
- **Touch buttons are always visible, even on desktop:** simplest, and makes the 844x390 touch check possible anywhere. Revisit with the settings screen.
- **No UI text in M1:** the 480x270 canvas can't render small text crisply; buttons use drawn icons until the bitmap pixel font arrives in M7.
- **Interact button icon is chosen by the target's object type (bed icon, otherwise a generic hand):** adding an object type means adding one icon entry.
- **Map layout lives in Tiled `.tmj` (`ground`, `collision`, `objects` layers); the transient `GameState.player` stores map id + px position:** teleporting through a door is just a state change, then a scene start.
- **`STATE_VERSION` stays at 1:** no saves exist yet; migrations start when SaveSystem lands in M6.
