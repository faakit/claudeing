# Decisions

- **Phaser 3.90.0, not 4.x:** the plan specifies Phaser 3; npm `latest` is now 4, so 3 is pinned explicitly.
- **TypeScript 6.0.3, not 7:** typescript-eslint 8.71 supports TS `<6.1` only.
- **Folder `farm-game/` inside the `claudeing` repo:** the repo already holds an unrelated app at its root, so the game is isolated in a subfolder.
- **Tileset generated at runtime, no PNG yet:** a canvas texture is built in `PreloadScene`; `farm.tmj` references `placeholder.png` only as a Tiled-editor hint and Phaser ignores it. No 1px extrusion until real art in M7.
- **Farm map built by `scripts/generate-farm-map.mjs`:** produces valid `.tmj` that stays editable in Tiled afterward; `collision` layer is hidden and unused until M1.
- **M0 camera is static, zoomed to fit the 40x30 map:** movement and follow camera belong to M1.
- **`GameState` stub added in M0:** keeps state serializable from the start, as the plan requires.
